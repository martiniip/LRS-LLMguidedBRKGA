To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their implications for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value indicates a longer run.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, considering the gap between consecutive identical characters. A higher value suggests a greater potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value indicates that the next occurrence is closer.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric gives an idea of how common a character is.

2. **Analyzing the Importance of Metrics**:
   - For LRS, a longer run (**normalized_length**) is generally more desirable as it directly contributes to the length of the subsequence.
   - **opportunity** is crucial because it considers the potential of a run to be included in the LRS, taking into account the gap between occurrences.
   - **distance_next** is important because a smaller distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol might indicate a higher chance of including the run in LRS, as it suggests the symbol is repeated closely.
   - **local_density** provides insight into the character's frequency, which can influence the likelihood of a run being part of LRS.

3. **Assigning Alpha Values**:
   - Given the definitions, **opportunity** and **normalized_length** seem to be directly relevant to the LRS problem, suggesting higher alpha values for these metrics.
   - Let's assign higher weights to **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, and distribute the remaining weight among **distance_next** and **local_density**.

4. **Assigning Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta should be close to 1.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is preferable, suggesting a beta value closer to 0.
   - For **local_density**, the desirable value depends on the context, but generally, a moderate value might be favorable.

Given these considerations, a plausible distribution could be:
- Alpha values: Higher for **opportunity** and **normalized_length**.
- Beta values: Close to 1 for **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, and closer to 0 for **distance_next**.

Let's propose:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5

Thus, the answer in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
