To determine the appropriate values for the $\alpha$ (alpha) and $\beta$ (beta) parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The task involves understanding how each of the four metrics (normalized_length, opportunity, distance_next, local_density) influences the selection process for LRS and assigning weights ($\alpha$ values) and desirable result factors ($\beta$ values) accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the subsequence.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as $1/(1 + gap)$. Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the current run is included.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric gives an idea of how common a character is.

2. **Analyzing the Influence**:
   - For LRS, a run with a higher **normalized_length** is more desirable because it directly contributes to the length of the subsequence.
   - A higher **opportunity** is desirable as it suggests a higher potential contribution to LRS.
   - A smaller **distance_next** is preferable because it implies that including the current run might allow for including another run of the same symbol soon, enhancing the subsequence length.
   - **local_density** is less directly related to the immediate desirability of a run but indicates the overall frequency of a character. A moderate **local_density** might be desirable as it suggests the character is not too rare or too common.

3. **Assigning Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - The $\alpha$ values should reflect the relative importance of each metric. For LRS, **opportunity** and **normalized_length** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and feasibility of the subsequence.
   - The $\beta$ values should be set such that they represent the desirable outcomes for each metric. For **normalized_length**, **opportunity**, and **local_density**, higher values are generally more desirable, suggesting $\beta$ values closer to 1. For **distance_next**, a lower value is desirable, so a $\beta$ closer to 0 might be appropriate.

Given the above considerations and without loss of generality or specific calculations provided in the steps due to the format constraint, let's directly infer the solution based on typical considerations for such problems:

alpha_1=0.2
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.6

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.2
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.6
