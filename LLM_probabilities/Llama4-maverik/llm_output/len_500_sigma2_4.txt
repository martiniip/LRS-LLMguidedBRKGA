To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as \(1/(1 + gap)\). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the runs are selected appropriately.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate how common a character is.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on the four metrics. The sigmoid function ensures the influence is within a certain range, making it easier to compare across different nodes.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial because they directly relate to the length of the subsequence and the potential for including more runs.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that can help in avoiding overlapping runs and selecting runs with characters that are not too frequent or too rare.

4. **Assigning Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - Let's assign higher alpha values to **normalized_length** and **opportunity** because they are directly related to the objective of maximizing the LRS length.
   - For beta values, we need to consider what values of the metrics are desirable. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are better, so beta values should be such that they favor higher metric values.

Given these considerations and without loss of generality or specific calculations due to the format constraint, let's directly infer the solution:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
