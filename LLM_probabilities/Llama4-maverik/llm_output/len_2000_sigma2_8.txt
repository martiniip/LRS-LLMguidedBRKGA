To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their implications on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is more desirable as it indicates a longer run.
   - `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS. A higher value is more desirable.
   - `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value might be more desirable as it indicates closer subsequent runs, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the runs are of the same symbol.
   - `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric's desirability can depend on the context; a higher value might indicate a more frequent character.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a weighted sum of the metrics. The weights (`alpha`) and the desirable result factors (`beta`) are crucial.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For `alpha`, the sum must equal 1. The distribution should reflect the relative importance of each metric. 
   - For `beta`, these are the thresholds or desirable values for each metric.

Given the LRS problem's nature, a longer run (`normalized_length`) and a higher `opportunity` are directly beneficial. `distance_next` being low is beneficial as it suggests that the next run of the same symbol is close, potentially allowing for a longer LRS. `local_density` being high might be beneficial as it indicates a frequently occurring symbol, potentially leading to a longer LRS if its runs are selected.

Let's assign values based on a reasonable assumption:
- `normalized_length` and `opportunity` are crucial, so they should have higher `alpha` values.
- `distance_next` is important for determining the potential for subsequent runs, so it should also have a significant `alpha`.
- `local_density` provides context on the symbol's frequency, so it's somewhat important.

A possible distribution could be:
- `alpha_1 = 0.3` for `normalized_length`
- `alpha_2 = 0.3` for `opportunity`
- `alpha_3 = 0.2` for `distance_next`
- `alpha_4 = 0.2` for `local_density`

For `beta`, assuming values that are somewhat central or slightly optimized for the metrics:
- `beta_1 = 0.5` for `normalized_length`, as a moderate to high value is desirable.
- `beta_2 = 0.5` for `opportunity`, as higher is better, but the scale isn't directly comparable to others.
- `beta_3 = 0.2` for `distance_next`, as lower is generally better, indicating a preference for closer next occurrences.
- `beta_4 = 0.5` for `local_density`, as a moderate value might be seen as favorable, balancing between very frequent and very rare symbols.

Thus, the answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.5
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
