To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more favorable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher local density might indicate a more frequent character, potentially beneficial for constructing a longer subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on its characteristics. The sigmoid function ensures the output is within a probability range (0,1). The alpha values weight the importance of each metric, and beta values adjust the desirable range for each metric.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For **alpha**, the values should reflect the relative importance of each metric. Given the LRS problem's nature, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS. **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context but might be less directly influential.
   - For **beta**, these values should represent the "desirable" or "threshold" values for each metric. For instance, a higher **beta** for **normalized_length** suggests that runs with lengths closer to this beta value are more desirable.

Given the problem's constraints and the metrics provided, a reasonable initial guess might prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, as they directly impact the LRS length. **distance_next** and **local_density** are also important but might be considered secondary.

Let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.25 (normalized_length)
- alpha_2 = 0.35 (opportunity, as it's directly related to the potential contribution)
- alpha_3 = 0.20 (distance_next)
- alpha_4 = 0.20 (local_density)

For beta values, considering the metrics' nature:
- beta_1 = 0.5 (normalized_length, as a moderate to high length is desirable)
- beta_2 = 0.2 (opportunity, suggesting that even moderate opportunity is valued)
- beta_3 = 0.1 (distance_next, indicating a preference for closer next occurrences)
- beta_4 = 0.07 (local_density, suggesting a moderate frequency is desirable)

Thus, the solution in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.20
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.1
beta_4=0.07
