To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their impact on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that the total length of the selected runs is maximized, and each symbol appears in at most one run.

The provided metrics are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap).
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The influence of a node (run) is calculated using a sigmoid function that combines these metrics with alpha and beta parameters. Alpha parameters weight the importance of each metric, and beta parameters indicate the desirable values for each metric.

Given the task, we aim to find alpha and beta values that best reflect the influence of each node on the LRS selection process.

alpha_1=0.1
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.3
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.6
beta_4=0.5
