To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that the total length of the selected subsequence is maximized, with the constraint that each symbol appears in at most one run.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is desirable as it indicates a longer run.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as `1/(1+gap)`. A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is desirable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, but in the context of LRS, it's about not overlapping and having a good distribution.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the commonality of the character.

For the LRS problem, `normalized_length` and `opportunity` seem directly relevant because a longer run (`normalized_length`) and a higher opportunity (lower gap) are generally favorable. `distance_next` is also relevant as it affects the selection of non-overlapping runs. `local_density` might be less directly relevant but could influence the decision by indicating the character's frequency.

Given the equation for Influence(N), the sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a node being selected.

To maximize the influence, we want to weight the metrics that are most important for the LRS problem. Let's consider:
- `normalized_length` is crucial because longer runs contribute more to the total length.
- `opportunity` is also important as it directly relates to the potential contribution to LRS.
- `distance_next` is relevant for ensuring that the selected runs do not overlap and are well-distributed.

Let's assign:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2

For beta values, which represent the desirable levels for each metric:
- For `normalized_length`, a higher value is better, so beta_1 should be high (e.g., 0.7 or 0.8) to indicate that values above this are more favorable.
- For `opportunity`, a higher value is better, so beta_2 should also be relatively high.
- For `distance_next`, a lower value is generally more desirable to avoid overlap, so beta_3 should be low (e.g., 0.2 or 0.3).
- For `local_density`, its importance is less direct, so it might have a moderate beta value.

Let's assign:
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.5

Thus, the output should be:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.5
