To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and the metrics provided for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that the total length of the selected subsequence is maximized, with the constraint that each symbol from the alphabet appears in at most one run.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is desirable as it indicates a longer run.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by `1/(1 + gap)`. A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is desirable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, but the direct influence is nuanced.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric's direct influence is less straightforward but relates to the character's overall presence.

Given the task, we aim to maximize the length of the subsequence (`normalized_length` is important) and consider the potential contribution (`opportunity`). The distance to the next occurrence (`distance_next`) and `local_density` provide additional context.

For alpha values, which represent the weighting coefficients, we need to distribute the weight among the four metrics. `normalized_length` and `opportunity` seem directly relevant to the LRS problem. Thus, they should have significant weights. `distance_next` and `local_density` provide supporting information.

For beta values, they indicate the desirable range for each metric. For `normalized_length` and `opportunity`, higher values are desirable, so beta should be close to 1. For `distance_next`, a lower value is preferable, so beta should be close to 0.

Let's assign:
- `alpha_1 = 0.3` for `normalized_length` as it's crucial for the length of the subsequence.
- `alpha_2 = 0.4` for `opportunity` since it directly relates to the potential contribution to LRS.
- `alpha_3 = 0.15` for `distance_next` as it provides some context on the subsequent occurrences.
- `alpha_4 = 0.15` for `local_density` to account for the character's frequency.

For beta:
- `beta_1 = 0.8` for `normalized_length` to favor higher lengths.
- `beta_2 = 0.8` for `opportunity` to favor higher opportunities.
- `beta_3 = 0.2` for `distance_next` to favor smaller distances.
- `beta_4 = 0.5` for `local_density`, as its desirability is less straightforward and might not be as critical.

Thus, the values are:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
