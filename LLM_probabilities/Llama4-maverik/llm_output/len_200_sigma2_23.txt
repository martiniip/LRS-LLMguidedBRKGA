To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their impact on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem aims to maximize the length of a subsequence composed of entire runs from the input string S, where each symbol appears in at most one run, and the selected runs preserve their original order without overlapping.

The given metrics are:
1. normalized_length: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. opportunity: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap).
3. distance_next: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. local_density: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

To solve this, let's consider the importance of each metric in the context of the LRS problem:
- normalized_length is crucial because longer runs contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
- opportunity is important as it estimates the potential contribution of a run to the LRS, considering the gap between runs.
- distance_next is relevant because a smaller distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol might indicate a higher chance of selecting subsequent runs, thus potentially increasing the LRS length.
- local_density affects the likelihood of a character being part of multiple runs; a higher local density might indicate a more significant potential for longer subsequences.

Given these considerations, we can infer that all metrics have some level of importance. However, without specific details on how each metric quantitatively affects the outcome, we will distribute the alpha values to reflect a balanced consideration of these factors.

Let's assign alpha values to reflect the relative importance of these metrics. Assuming all metrics are somewhat important but not equally so, we might prioritize normalized_length and opportunity as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution to the LRS.

For beta values, they represent the desirable results for each metric. For normalized_length, opportunity, and local_density, higher values are generally more desirable, suggesting beta values closer to 1. For distance_next, a lower value is more desirable, indicating a closer next occurrence, so a beta value closer to 0 might be suitable.

Let's propose the following values based on the above reasoning:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.7

Thus, the answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.7
