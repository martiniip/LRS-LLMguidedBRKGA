To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be preferable to avoid overlapping runs.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the prevalence of a character.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on the four metrics, using alpha and beta parameters. Alpha values weight the importance of each metric, and beta values represent the desirable outcome for each metric.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For **alpha**, the sum of all alpha values must equal 1. The values should reflect the relative importance of each metric in determining the influence of a node. For LRS, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run.
   - For **beta**, these values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For instance, a high **normalized_length** is desirable, so beta_1 should be close to 1.

Given the problem's constraints and the metrics provided, a reasonable assumption is to prioritize **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, as they directly impact the LRS. Thus, higher alpha values for these metrics are justified.

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5
