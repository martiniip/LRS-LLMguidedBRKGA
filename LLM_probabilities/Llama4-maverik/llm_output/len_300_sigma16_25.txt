To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more desirable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher local density might indicate a more frequent character, which could be beneficial.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability or influence of a node.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) values** represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must be 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) values** are the thresholds or reference points for each metric, indicating where the favorable values lie.

Given the nature of the LRS problem, a run with a higher **normalized_length** and **opportunity** is generally more desirable. **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that could influence the selection, but their importance might be secondary to the length and opportunity.

Without loss of generality and based on the typical considerations for such problems, we might assign higher importance to **normalized_length** and **opportunity**. Let's consider a distribution where **opportunity** and **normalized_length** are given more weight.

For simplicity, let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.3 for normalized_length
- alpha_2 = 0.4 for opportunity, as it directly relates to the potential contribution to LRS
- alpha_3 = 0.15 for distance_next
- alpha_4 = 0.15 for local_density

For beta values, which represent the desirable thresholds:
- beta_1 = 0.5 for normalized_length, suggesting that values around or above 0.5 are favorable
- beta_2 = 0.2 for opportunity, indicating that values above this are considered good
- beta_3 = 0.1 for distance_next, suggesting that smaller distances are preferred
- beta_4 = 0.05 for local_density, indicating a preference for higher densities

Thus, the values could be:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.1
beta_4=0.05
