To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the subsequence.
   - `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as \(1/(1 + gap)\). Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate how common a character is.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the four metrics, using alpha and beta parameters to weight and adjust the metrics.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - Alpha values (\(\alpha_i\)) represent the weighting coefficients for each metric. The sum of all alpha values must equal 1. The distribution of alpha values should reflect the relative importance of each metric in determining the influence of a node.
   - Beta values (\(\beta_i\)) are factors that indicate the desirable results for each metric. They serve as a kind of "threshold" or "reference point" for the metrics.

Given the nature of the Longest Run Subsequence problem, we prioritize metrics that directly contribute to the length and feasibility of the subsequence. 

- `normalized_length` and `opportunity` are directly related to the length and potential contribution of a run, making them highly relevant.
- `distance_next` is important because it affects the possibility of selecting subsequent runs without violating the non-overlap constraint.
- `local_density` provides context about the character's frequency, which can indirectly influence the selection by indicating the potential for future runs.

Assuming equal importance for simplicity, and considering the direct relevance of `normalized_length` and `opportunity` to the problem's objective, we might assign higher alpha values to these metrics. However, without specific guidance on their relative importance, a balanced approach could be to distribute the alpha values relatively evenly, ensuring they sum to 1.

For beta values, they should reflect the "desirable" or "average" values for the metrics. For instance, a beta value for `normalized_length` might be around 0.5 if we consider a moderate length to be desirable.

Let's assign:
alpha_1 = 0.3
alpha_2 = 0.3
alpha_3 = 0.2
alpha_4 = 0.2
beta_1 = 0.5
beta_2 = 0.2
beta_3 = 0.1
beta_4 = 0.25

Thus, the response in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.1
beta_4=0.25
