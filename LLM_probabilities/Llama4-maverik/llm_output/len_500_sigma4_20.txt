To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially limiting the length of the current run or subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate how common a character is.

2. **Analyzing the Influence**:
   - For LRS, we want runs that are long (**normalized_length** is high), have a high potential contribution (**opportunity** is high), are not too close to the next occurrence of the same symbol to avoid overlap (**distance_next** is not too low), and are of characters that are not too frequent (**local_density** is moderate to low, as very high frequency might not be desirable due to potential overlaps).

3. **Assigning Alpha Values**:
   - **alpha_1** (for **normalized_length**): High values are desirable, so it should have a significant weight.
   - **alpha_2** (for **opportunity**): High opportunity is desirable, indicating a significant weight.
   - **alpha_3** (for **distance_next**): A moderate to high distance is desirable to avoid immediate repetition, but not so high that it ignores the metric entirely. Thus, a moderate weight could be appropriate.
   - **alpha_4** (for **local_density**): Moderate to low local density might be desirable to avoid too frequent characters, but its importance can be less than length and opportunity.

4. **Assigning Beta Values**:
   - **beta_1, beta_2, beta_3, beta_4**: These represent the desirable levels for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, high values are desirable, so beta values should be near 1. For **distance_next**, a moderate value might be desirable, and for **local_density**, it depends on the context, but a moderate value could be a balance.

Given these considerations and without specific optimization or further details, a reasonable initial guess could be:
- Assigning higher alpha values to **normalized_length** and **opportunity** as they directly relate to the length and potential of the LRS.
- Moderate alpha for **distance_next** to ensure it's considered but not overly prioritized.
- Lower alpha for **local_density** as it's less directly related to the immediate goal of maximizing LRS length.

Let's consider a distribution: alpha_1 = 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.3, alpha_3 = 0.2, alpha_4 = 0.2. This gives significant weight to length and opportunity, and moderate consideration to distance and density.

For beta values, considering high values are desirable for **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, and a moderate **distance_next** is acceptable:
- beta_1 = 1.0 (high normalized length is very desirable)
- beta_2 = 1.0 (high opportunity is very desirable)
- beta_3 = 0.5 (moderate distance next is somewhat desirable, indicating a balance)
- beta_4 = 0.5 (moderate local density is somewhat desirable)

Thus, the output in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=1.0
beta_2=1.0
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.5
