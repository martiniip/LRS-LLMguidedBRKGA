To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, considering the gap between runs. Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be preferable as it indicates a potential for a longer subsequence without overlapping symbols.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the prevalence of a character and its potential impact on the LRS.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a weighted sum of its metrics. The weights (alpha values) determine the relative importance of each metric, and the beta values adjust the desirable range for each metric.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS. Thus, their alpha values should be significant.
   - **distance_next** is important for ensuring that the selected runs do not overlap and are well-spaced, suggesting a moderate alpha value.
   - **local_density** might be less directly influential but still relevant for understanding the character's frequency and its impact on the LRS, potentially having a lower alpha value compared to the other metrics.

Given these considerations and without specific numerical analysis or optimization results provided in the question, a reasonable assumption based on the importance of the metrics could be:
- Assigning higher importance to **normalized_length** and **opportunity** because they directly influence the LRS length and potential.
- Moderate importance to **distance_next** for spacing and non-overlap.
- Lower importance to **local_density** as it's more about the character's overall frequency.

Thus, a plausible distribution could be:
alpha_1 = 0.3
alpha_2 = 0.4
alpha_3 = 0.2
alpha_4 = 0.1

For beta values, which indicate the desirable range or threshold for each metric:
- Assuming a neutral or slightly favorable stance towards higher values for **normalized_length**, **opportunity**, and lower values for **distance_next**, and a moderate stance for **local_density**.

Thus, plausible beta values could be:
beta_1 = 0.5
beta_2 = 0.5
beta_3 = 0.2
beta_4 = 0.5

Outputting the values in the required format:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.5
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
