To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs from a given string such that the total length of the selected runs is maximized, and each symbol appears in at most one run.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by \(1/(1 + gap)\).
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The influence of a node (run) is calculated using a sigmoid function that combines these metrics with alpha and beta parameters. The alpha parameters weight the importance of each metric, and the beta parameters represent the desirable values or thresholds for these metrics.

Given the nature of the LRS problem, we can infer the following:
- `normalized_length` is important because longer runs contribute more to the total length.
- `opportunity` is crucial as it directly relates to the potential of a run being included in the LRS.
- `distance_next` is relevant because a larger distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol reduces the likelihood of overlap and thus is favorable.
- `local_density` indicates the frequency of a character and could influence the selection based on how common a character is.

To maximize the LRS, we want runs that are long (`normalized_length` is high), have a high `opportunity`, are followed by a significant `distance_next` to avoid overlap, and potentially have a balanced `local_density` to ensure diversity.

Let's assign values based on these considerations:
- For `alpha`, we need to distribute the weight among the four metrics. Given that `normalized_length` and `opportunity` are directly related to the objective, they might be given more weight. Let's assign `alpha_1 = 0.3`, `alpha_2 = 0.3`, `alpha_3 = 0.2`, and `alpha_4 = 0.2`, reflecting a slightly higher importance on length and opportunity.
- For `beta`, these are the desirable thresholds. For `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, a higher value is desirable, so `beta_1`, `beta_2`, and `beta_4` could be around 0.8 or higher, indicating a preference for high values. For `distance_next`, a higher value is also desirable to minimize overlap, so `beta_3` could similarly be around 0.8.

Thus, a possible assignment could be:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.8
beta_4=0.7

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.8
beta_4=0.7
