To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they relate to the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting a subsequence of runs from the input string such that each symbol appears in at most one run, and the total length of the subsequence is maximized.

The given metrics are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is more desirable as it contributes more to the total length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as `1/(1+gap)`. A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is preferable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric might indicate the importance or commonality of the character.

For the LRS problem, the most critical factor is maximizing the total length of the subsequence. Thus, `normalized_length` is crucial. `opportunity` is also significant as it directly relates to the potential of a run to contribute to the LRS. `distance_next` is important because a smaller distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol can indicate a better chance of including more runs in the LRS. `local_density` might be less directly related but still provides context on the character's frequency.

Let's assign values based on the relative importance of these metrics for the LRS problem.

alpha_1=0.4
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.6
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.4
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.6
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5
