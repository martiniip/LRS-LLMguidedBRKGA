To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A larger distance might be more desirable as it reduces the likelihood of overlap between selected runs.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the string. A moderate value might be desirable, but its importance can vary depending on the context.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The alpha values weight the importance of each metric, and beta values represent the desirable levels for each metric.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For **alpha**, the values should reflect the relative importance of each metric. Given the LRS problem's nature, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run. **distance_next** is also important to avoid overlap. **local_density** might be less directly influential but still relevant.
   - For **beta**, these are the target or desirable values for each metric. For **normalized_length**, **opportunity**, and **distance_next**, higher values are generally more desirable, suggesting beta values close to 1. For **local_density**, the desirable value isn't as straightforward and might depend on the distribution of characters.

Given the problem's constraints and the metrics provided, a reasonable initial guess might prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, followed by **distance_next**, and then **local_density**. For beta, values close to 1 for **normalized_length**, **opportunity**, and **distance_next** could be appropriate, indicating a preference for higher values. For **local_density**, a moderate beta might be considered, but given the lack of clear direction, a value of 0.5 could be a starting point, suggesting a moderate desirable level.

Let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.25 (normalized_length)
- alpha_2 = 0.35 (opportunity)
- alpha_3 = 0.25 (distance_next)
- alpha_4 = 0.15 (local_density)
- beta_1 = 0.8 (normalized_length)
- beta_2 = 0.9 (opportunity)
- beta_3 = 0.8 (distance_next)
- beta_4 = 0.5 (local_density)

Thus, the output in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.25
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.9
beta_3=0.8
beta_4=0.5
