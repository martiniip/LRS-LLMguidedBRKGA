To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters. The task involves understanding the influence of each node on the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence problem.

The given metrics are:
1. normalized_length
2. opportunity
3. distance_next
4. local_density

Each of these metrics has a corresponding alpha value that represents its weighting coefficient in the influence calculation. The sum of all alpha values must equal 1.

The beta values represent the desirable results for each metric, indicating their relative importance.

To determine the appropriate alpha and beta values, we need to understand the significance of each metric in the context of the Longest Run Subsequence problem.

1. **normalized_length**: This metric represents the length of the run normalized by the total string length. A higher value is more desirable as it indicates a longer run, which is beneficial for the LRS.

2. **opportunity**: This is an estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS. A higher opportunity value is desirable.

3. **distance_next**: This metric represents the normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is desirable because it indicates that the next occurrence of the symbol is closer, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.

4. **local_density**: This represents the frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher local density might be desirable as it indicates the character's prevalence.

Given the nature of the LRS problem, the most critical factors are likely to be **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS.

Let's assign alpha values based on the perceived importance of these metrics:
- **alpha_1 = 0.3** for normalized_length, as it's crucial for determining the length of the subsequence.
- **alpha_2 = 0.3** for opportunity, as it directly influences the potential contribution to LRS.
- **alpha_3 = 0.2** for distance_next, since having the next occurrence of a symbol closer is beneficial but not as critical as the length or opportunity.
- **alpha_4 = 0.2** for local_density, as it provides context on the character's frequency but is less directly impactful on the LRS length.

For beta values, which represent the desirable outcomes:
- **beta_1 = 0.8** for normalized_length, indicating a preference for longer runs.
- **beta_2 = 0.7** for opportunity, suggesting a high opportunity is desirable.
- **beta_3 = 0.3** for distance_next, indicating a preference for closer next occurrences.
- **beta_4 = 0.6** for local_density, suggesting a moderate preference for higher density.

Thus, the values are:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.6
