To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the subsequence.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more desirable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the prevalence of a character; a moderate value might be desirable as it balances between common and rare characters.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha Values**: These represent the relative importance of each metric. To maximize the LRS, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of runs. Thus, higher alpha values for these metrics might be appropriate. Let's assign alpha_1 = 0.3 for **normalized_length** and alpha_2 = 0.4 for **opportunity**, indicating their significant importance. **distance_next** and **local_density** can be considered less directly influential but still important; thus, alpha_3 = 0.15 and alpha_4 = 0.15.
   - **Beta Values**: These are the desirable values or thresholds for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta_1 and beta_2 should be high (e.g., 0.8 or 0.9). For **distance_next**, a lower value is preferable, suggesting a lower beta_3 (e.g., 0.2). For **local_density**, a moderate value might be desirable, so beta_4 could be around 0.5.

Given these considerations, here are the values in the required format:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.9
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
