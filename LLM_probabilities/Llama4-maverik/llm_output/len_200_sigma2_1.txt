To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is preferable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the string. A higher or lower value might be desirable depending on the context, but generally, a balanced density is beneficial.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a node being included in the LRS.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) values** represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must be 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) values** are the thresholds or reference points for each metric, indicating the desirable range.

Given the LRS problem's nature, we prioritize:
- Higher **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, as they directly contribute to the length and feasibility of the LRS.
- Lower **distance_next**, as closer subsequent occurrences of the same symbol can be beneficial.
- **local_density** is somewhat context-dependent, but a moderate value might be desirable.

Thus, we might prioritize **normalized_length** and **opportunity** more, followed by **distance_next**, and then **local_density**.

Let's assign:
- \(\alpha_1 = 0.3\) for **normalized_length**, as it's crucial for the LRS length.
- \(\alpha_2 = 0.3\) for **opportunity**, reflecting its importance in the LRS.
- \(\alpha_3 = 0.2\) for **distance_next**, as it's less directly influential but still important.
- \(\alpha_4 = 0.2\) for **local_density**, considering its contextual importance.

For \(\beta\) values, we consider the desirable range for each metric:
- \(\beta_1 = 0.5\) for **normalized_length**, suggesting that values around or above this are desirable.
- \(\beta_2 = 0.2\) for **opportunity**, indicating that higher opportunities are favored.
- \(\beta_3 = 0.1\) for **distance_next**, showing a preference for closer next occurrences.
- \(\beta_4 = 0.5\) for **local_density**, suggesting a moderate density is desirable.
