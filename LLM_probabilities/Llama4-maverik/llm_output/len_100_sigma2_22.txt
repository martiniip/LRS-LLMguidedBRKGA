To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs from a given string such that the total length of the selected subsequence is maximized, with the constraint that each symbol appears in at most one run and the selected runs preserve their original order.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is desirable as it indicates a longer run.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by $1/(1 + gap)$. A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is desirable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher value might be more desirable as it indicates a more frequent character.

Given these metrics, we want to maximize `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, while minimizing `distance_next`. 

The equation provided to calculate the influence of a node is:
\[ \text{Influence(N)} = \text{sigmoid}\left(\alpha_1 \cdot (1 - (\beta_1 - normalized-length)) + \alpha_2 \cdot (1 - (\beta_2 - opportunity)) + \alpha_3 \cdot (1 - (\beta_3 - distance-next)) + \alpha_4 \cdot (1 - (\beta_4 - local_density))\right) \]

To simplify, let's consider the desirable direction for each metric:
- For `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, higher values are better.
- For `distance_next`, a lower value is better.

Let's assign beta values first, considering the range of the metrics and their desirable values. Beta values represent the threshold or desirable level for each metric.

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.25
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.25
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.5
beta_3=0.3
beta_4=0.5
