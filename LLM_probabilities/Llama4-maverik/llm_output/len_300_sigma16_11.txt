To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the runs are selected appropriately.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate how common a character is and thus how likely it is to appear in the LRS.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on the four metrics. The sigmoid function ensures the output is between 0 and 1, representing the probability or influence of selecting a run.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **opportunity** and **normalized_length** seem crucial because they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that can influence the selection, but their importance might be secondary to the direct contribution metrics.

4. **Determining Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are more desirable, so beta values should reflect this by being closer to 1 or exactly 1 if the metric's maximum value is desirable.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is generally more desirable as it indicates the next occurrence of the symbol is closer, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence. Thus, a beta value that reflects a preference for lower distances is appropriate.
   - For **local_density**, the desirability can depend on the context, but generally, a moderate to high value might be desirable as it indicates the character is relatively common.

Given these considerations and without specific numerical analysis or optimization results provided in the question, a reasonable guess based on the importance of the metrics for the LRS problem could be:

alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.20
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.9
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.6

This reflects a higher importance on **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, with **distance_next** and **local_density** being somewhat important. The beta values suggest that high **opportunity** and **normalized_length** are desirable, low **distance_next** is desirable, and a moderate **local_density** is desirable. 

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.20
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.9
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.6
