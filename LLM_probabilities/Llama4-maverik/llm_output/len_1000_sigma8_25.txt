To determine the appropriate values for the $\alpha$ (alpha) and $\beta$ (beta) parameters that best reflect the influence of each node on the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence problem, we need to analyze the given metrics and understand their implications.

1. **Normalized Length**: This metric indicates the length of a run relative to the total length of the string. A higher value is more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the subsequence.

2. **Opportunity**: Estimated as $1/(1 + gap)$, where $gap$ is presumably the distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A higher opportunity value indicates a smaller gap, making the run more valuable as it allows for a potentially longer subsequence without overlapping symbols.

3. **Distance to Next**: The normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is more desirable as it indicates that the next occurrence is closer, potentially allowing for a more efficient packing of runs into the subsequence.

4. **Local Density**: The frequency of the character in the string. A higher local density might indicate a more common character, but its desirability depends on the context of the LRS problem.

For the LRS problem, the goal is to maximize the total length of the subsequence composed of entire runs. Thus, the **Normalized Length** and **Opportunity** are likely to be crucial as they directly relate to the length and the potential for including a run without violating the constraints.

Let's analyze the parameters:

- **Alpha ($\alpha$) values** represent the weighting coefficients. The sum of all $\alpha$ values must equal 1. To maximize the length of the LRS, we should prioritize metrics that directly contribute to this goal.

- **Beta ($\beta$) values** indicate the desirable level for each metric. For **Normalized Length** and **Opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so $\beta$ should be high. For **Distance to Next**, a lower value is desirable, so $\beta$ should be low. For **Local Density**, the desirability might depend on whether the character is too frequent or not, but generally, a moderate to high value could be considered favorable as it might indicate a common character that can be part of the subsequence.

Given these considerations:

- **Normalized Length** is crucial, so $\alpha_1$ should be significant.
- **Opportunity** is also crucial as it affects the ability to include subsequent runs, so $\alpha_2$ should be significant.
- **Distance to Next** is important for the same reason as opportunity; it's about the gap, so $\alpha_3$ could be considered in relation to $\alpha_2$.
- **Local Density** might be less directly influential on the immediate decision but still relevant.

Let's assign values:
- $\alpha_1 = 0.3$ (Normalized Length is important)
- $\alpha_2 = 0.3$ (Opportunity is crucial for packing runs efficiently)
- $\alpha_3 = 0.2$ (Distance to Next is related to Opportunity but slightly less directly influential)
- $\alpha_4 = 0.2$ (Local Density is somewhat important but less directly influential on the immediate decision)

For $\beta$ values:
- $\beta_1 = 0.8$ (High normalized length is desirable)
- $\beta_2 = 0.8$ (High opportunity is desirable)
- $\beta_3 = 0.2$ (Low distance to next is desirable, so $\beta_3$ is low)
- $\beta_4 = 0.5$ (Moderate local density might be considered neutral or somewhat desirable)

Thus, the solution in the required format is:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
