To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be preferable to avoid overlapping runs and to keep the sequence valid.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the commonality of a character.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on its characteristics. The sigmoid function ensures the output is between 0 and 1, representing the probability or influence of selecting a node.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) values** represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must be 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) values** are the desirable results for each metric, indicating their relative importance.

Given the LRS problem's nature, we want to prioritize runs that are long (**normalized_length**), have a high potential contribution (**opportunity**), are not too far from the next occurrence of the same symbol but also not too close to cause overlap (**distance_next**), and occur frequently in the string (**local_density**).

Let's assign:
- High importance to **normalized_length** and **opportunity** because they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of the subsequence.
- Moderate importance to **distance_next** and **local_density** as they are also relevant but slightly less direct in their impact.

Thus, a possible distribution could be:
- \(\alpha_1 = 0.3\) for **normalized_length**
- \(\alpha_2 = 0.3\) for **opportunity**
- \(\alpha_3 = 0.2\) for **distance_next**
- \(\alpha_4 = 0.2\) for **local_density**

For **beta** values, we consider what values are desirable for each metric:
- For **normalized_length**, a high value is desirable, so \(\beta_1 = 0.8\) (indicating a preference for longer runs).
- For **opportunity**, a high value is desirable, so \(\beta_2 = 0.8\).
- For **distance_next**, a moderate value might be desirable to avoid too much overlap or too much gap, so \(\beta_3 = 0.5\).
- For **local_density**, a higher value could be seen as more desirable as it indicates a more common character, so \(\beta_4 = 0.6\).

Therefore, the values are:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.6
