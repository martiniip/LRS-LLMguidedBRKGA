To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and the metrics provided for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that each symbol appears in at most one run, and the total length of the selected runs is maximized.

The metrics given are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by \(1/(1 + gap)\), where `gap` likely refers to the distance or gap between consecutive occurrences of the same symbol or run.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The influence of a node (run) is calculated using a sigmoid function that combines these metrics with alpha and beta parameters. The alpha parameters weight the importance of each metric, and the beta parameters represent the desirable or expected values for these metrics.

Given the goal of maximizing the total length of the selected runs and ensuring that each symbol appears in at most one run, we can infer the following:

- `normalized_length` is crucial because longer runs contribute more to the total length.
- `opportunity` is important as it reflects the potential contribution of a run to the LRS.
- `distance_next` is relevant because a smaller distance to the next occurrence might indicate a higher likelihood of selecting subsequent runs with the same symbol, which is undesirable.
- `local_density` could be less directly relevant but still important as it indicates the frequency of the character.

To maximize the LRS, we want to prioritize runs with high `normalized_length` and `opportunity`, and potentially those with a reasonable `distance_next` to avoid overlapping or closely situated runs with the same symbol. `local_density` might be less critical but still relevant for understanding the distribution of characters.

Let's consider assigning values:
- `alpha_1` to `normalized_length`: High importance, e.g., 0.3
- `alpha_2` to `opportunity`: High importance, e.g., 0.3
- `alpha_3` to `distance_next`: Moderate importance, e.g., 0.2, as it's about avoiding too close next occurrences.
- `alpha_4` to `local_density`: Lower importance, e.g., 0.2, as it's more about the character's overall frequency.

For beta values, which represent desirable outcomes:
- `beta_1` for `normalized_length`: High, e.g., 0.8, indicating a preference for longer runs.
- `beta_2` for `opportunity`: High, e.g., 0.8, as higher opportunity is desirable.
- `beta_3` for `distance_next`: Moderate to low, e.g., 0.4, suggesting that a moderate distance is acceptable or desirable to avoid too close or too far next occurrences.
- `beta_4` for `local_density`: Moderate, e.g., 0.5, as it depends on the overall distribution.

Thus, a possible distribution could be:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5
