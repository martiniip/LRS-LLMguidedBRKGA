To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are more significant for LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially affecting the selection due to the non-overlap constraint.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the string. This could influence the likelihood of a run being selected based on the character's overall presence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence**:
   - For LRS, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** are likely crucial because they directly relate to the length of the subsequence and the potential for including more runs without overlap.
   - **distance_next** is also important as it indicates how soon the same symbol appears again, affecting whether including a run would prevent including another significant run of the same symbol.
   - **local_density** might be less directly influential but still relevant as it indicates the character's frequency.

3. **Assigning Alpha Values**:
   - Given the importance of **normalized_length** and **opportunity** for directly contributing to the LRS, they should have higher alpha values.
   - **distance_next** is also crucial for ensuring non-overlapping runs, so it should have a significant alpha value.
   - **local_density** is somewhat relevant but might be less critical than the other metrics for directly determining the LRS.

4. **Assigning Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should reflect a preference for values closer to 1.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is generally more desirable as it indicates the next occurrence is closer, but the beta value should be set considering the balance between proximity and the ability to include non-overlapping runs.
   - For **local_density**, the desirable value might depend on the context, but generally, a moderate value could be considered favorable.

Given these considerations and without specific numerical analysis or optimization provided in the steps due to the format constraint, a reasonable distribution could be:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5
