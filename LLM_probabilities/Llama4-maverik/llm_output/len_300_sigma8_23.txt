To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be preferable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate the overall importance or commonality of a character.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on the four metrics. The sigmoid function ensures the influence is within a certain range, making it suitable for representing a probability or a normalized score.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context but might be less directly influential on the decision.

4. **Determining Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range or threshold for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should reflect a preference for values closer to 1.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is generally more desirable, indicating a closer next occurrence. Thus, a beta value that reflects a preference for lower values is appropriate.
   - For **local_density**, the desirability might depend on the context, but generally, a moderate to high value could be seen as favorable as it indicates a relatively common character.

Given these considerations and without specific numerical analysis or optimization results provided in the question, a reasonable guess based on the importance of the metrics for the LRS problem could be:

- Assigning higher alpha values to **normalized_length** and **opportunity** because they are directly related to the objective of maximizing the LRS length.
- Setting beta values to reflect the desirable outcomes for each metric.

Let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.3 for normalized_length, considering its direct impact on LRS length.
- alpha_2 = 0.4 for opportunity, as it directly estimates the potential contribution to LRS.
- alpha_3 = 0.15 for distance_next, reflecting its moderate importance.
- alpha_4 = 0.15 for local_density, as it provides context but is less directly influential.

And for beta values, considering the desirable outcomes:
- beta_1 = 0.8 (preferring higher normalized lengths).
- beta_2 = 0.8 (preferring higher opportunities).
- beta_3 = 0.2 (preferring lower distances to the next occurrence).
- beta_4 = 0.5 (a moderate local density is somewhat desirable).

Thus, the output in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
