To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more desirable as it indicates a potential for a longer subsequence without repeating symbols too quickly.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A moderate value might be desirable; too high could mean the character is overrepresented, and too low might mean it's underrepresented.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** are also important but might be considered secondary as they influence the selection indirectly by considering the distribution and potential overlap of runs.

4. **Determining Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should be high (close to 1).
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is desirable to avoid too much repetition, suggesting a low beta value.
   - For **local_density**, a moderate value is desirable, but since it's a frequency measure, a beta value that represents a moderate frequency (not too high, not too low) could be around 0.5.

Given these considerations and without loss of generality or specific calculations due to the format constraint, a plausible distribution could prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length** highly. Let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.3 for normalized_length
- alpha_2 = 0.4 for opportunity, as it's directly related to the potential contribution
- alpha_3 = 0.15 for distance_next
- alpha_4 = 0.15 for local_density

And for beta values, considering the desirable outcomes:
- beta_1 = 0.8 (high normalized length is desirable)
- beta_2 = 0.8 (high opportunity is desirable)
- beta_3 = 0.2 (low distance to next is desirable)
- beta_4 = 0.5 (moderate local density is desirable)

Thus, the output in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
