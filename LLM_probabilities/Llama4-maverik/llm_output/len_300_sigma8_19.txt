To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they relate to the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting a subsequence of runs from the input string such that each symbol appears in at most one run, and the total length of the selected subsequence is maximized.

The given metrics are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap).
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The influence of a node (run) is calculated using a sigmoid function that combines these metrics with alpha and beta parameters. The alpha parameters weight the importance of each metric, and the beta parameters indicate the desirable values or thresholds for these metrics.

To solve this, let's consider the role of each metric in the context of the LRS problem:
- `normalized_length` is important because longer runs contribute more to the total length of the subsequence.
- `opportunity` is crucial as it estimates the potential contribution of a run to the LRS.
- `distance_next` is relevant because a smaller distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol might indicate a higher likelihood of selecting runs with the same symbol, which is undesirable.
- `local_density` could be important as it reflects the frequency of the character, potentially influencing the selection based on how common or rare the character is.

Given the problem's constraints and the metrics provided, we need to infer appropriate alpha and beta values. 

alpha_1=0.2
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.5

Thus, the answer is:
alpha_1=0.2
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.5
