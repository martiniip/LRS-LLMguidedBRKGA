To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the subsequence.
   - `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as `1/(1+gap)`. Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the runs are selected appropriately.
   - `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric can indicate how common a character is and thus how likely it is to appear in a long subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a weighted sum of its metrics. The weights (`alpha` values) determine the relative importance of each metric, and the `beta` values adjust the influence based on how close the metric values are to these reference points.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - For `alpha` values, we need to distribute the weight among the four metrics. Given the problem's nature, `normalized_length` and `opportunity` seem crucial because they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of the runs. `distance_next` and `local_density` provide additional context that could be important but might be less directly influential.
   - For `beta` values, these should reflect the desirable or average values for each metric. For instance, a high `beta` for `normalized_length` would mean that values close to this `beta` are considered favorable.

Given the constraints and the format required for the answer, and without specific calculations or further details on the distribution of alpha and beta, a reasonable distribution considering the importance of the metrics could be:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.1
beta_4=0.03

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.1
beta_4=0.03
