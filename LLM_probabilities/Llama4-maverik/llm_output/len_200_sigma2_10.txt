To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they relate to the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting a subsequence of runs from the input string S, such that the total length of the subsequence is maximized, and each symbol appears in at most one run.

The given metrics are:
1. normalized_length: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. opportunity: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by 1/(1 + gap).
3. distance_next: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. local_density: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

For the LRS problem, a longer run (higher normalized_length) is generally more desirable because it contributes more to the total length of the subsequence. A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially greater contribution to the LRS. A larger distance_next might be less desirable as it could indicate a larger gap between the current and next occurrence of the symbol, potentially reducing the effectiveness of including the current run. A higher local_density might indicate that the character is more frequent, potentially making runs of this character more valuable.

Let's assign values based on these considerations:

- normalized_length and opportunity are directly related to the desirability of a run for the LRS. Thus, they should have higher weights.
- distance_next is less directly related but still important as it affects the selection of non-overlapping runs.
- local_density provides context on the character's frequency, which can influence the run's value.

Let's consider alpha values first. We want to prioritize normalized_length and opportunity, so they should have higher alpha values. distance_next and local_density are also important but slightly less directly related to the immediate goal of maximizing the subsequence length.

For beta values, they represent the desirable results for each metric. For normalized_length, opportunity, and local_density, higher values are generally more desirable, so their beta values should reflect the maximum or a high value within the range of the metric. For distance_next, a lower value is more desirable, so its beta should be low.

Given these considerations and without loss of generality, let's propose the following values:

alpha_1 = 0.3
alpha_2 = 0.4
alpha_3 = 0.15
alpha_4 = 0.15

beta_1 = 0.8
beta_2 = 0.8
beta_3 = 0.2
beta_4 = 0.7

Thus, the answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.7
