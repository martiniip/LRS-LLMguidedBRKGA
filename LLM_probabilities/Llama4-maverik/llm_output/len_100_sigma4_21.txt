To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their impact on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) such that the total length of the selected subsequence is maximized, with the constraint that each symbol from the alphabet appears in at most one run.

The given metrics are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. A higher value is preferable as it contributes more to the total length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as $1/(1 + gap)$. A higher value indicates a better opportunity.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value is preferable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher value might indicate a more frequent character, potentially influencing the selection.

The influence equation provided combines these metrics with alpha and beta parameters to assign a probability range to each node (run). The alpha parameters weight the importance of each metric, and the beta parameters indicate the desirable values or thresholds for these metrics.

Given the task, let's directly infer the required format for the answer based on a logical analysis of the metrics and their implications for the LRS problem.

For `alpha` values, which represent the weighting coefficients:
- `normalized_length` is crucial because longer runs directly contribute to a longer subsequence.
- `opportunity` is also significant as it estimates the potential contribution.
- `distance_next` is important because a smaller distance to the next occurrence can be beneficial.
- `local_density` provides context on character frequency.

For `beta` values, which indicate desirable results:
- For `normalized_length`, a higher value is desirable.
- For `opportunity`, a higher value is better.
- For `distance_next`, a lower value is preferable, so the beta value should reflect a low desirable distance.
- For `local_density`, a moderate to high value might be desirable as it indicates a relatively frequent character.

Let's assign values based on these considerations.

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.6

Thus, the answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.6
