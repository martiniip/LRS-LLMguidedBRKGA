To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, considering the gap between consecutive occurrences of the same symbol. Higher opportunity values indicate a potentially greater contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might indicate a higher likelihood of selecting consecutive runs of the same symbol, potentially increasing the LRS length.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. Characters with higher local density might be more likely to be included in the LRS as they appear more frequently.

2. **Analyzing the Influence**:
   - The influence of a node (run) on the LRS selection is a function of its characteristics (normalized_length, opportunity, distance_next, local_density). The sigmoid function is used to normalize the influence between 0 and 1.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) values** represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must equal 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) values** are used to scale the metrics, indicating the desirable range for each.

Given the problem's constraints and the goal to maximize the LRS length, we prioritize metrics that directly contribute to this objective.

- **normalized_length** and **opportunity** are directly related to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS. Thus, they should have significant weights.
- **distance_next** affects the selection by indicating how soon the same symbol appears again, potentially influencing the LRS length.
- **local_density** provides insight into the character's frequency, which can indirectly affect the LRS by favoring more frequent characters.

Assuming equal importance for simplicity and based on the problem's description, we could distribute the alpha values to reflect a balanced consideration of these factors.

alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.25
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.6
beta_3=0.4
beta_4=0.5
