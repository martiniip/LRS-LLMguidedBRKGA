To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more favorable as it indicates closer subsequent runs of the same symbol, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher local density might indicate a more common character, which could be favorable if it doesn't violate the non-overlap constraint.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha Values**: These represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all alpha values must be 1.
   - **Beta Values**: These are the thresholds or desirable values for each metric. They help in determining how the difference between the actual metric value and the desirable value affects the influence.

Given the LRS problem's nature, a run with a higher **normalized_length** and **opportunity** is generally more desirable. **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that can influence the selection based on the potential for subsequent runs and the character's frequency.

Without loss of generality and based on the typical considerations for such problems, we might prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length** as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of the subsequence. **distance_next** could be less important if the opportunity is already high, and **local_density** might be the least critical as it's more about the character's overall frequency rather than its contribution to the LRS.

Let's assign:
alpha_1 = 0.25
alpha_2 = 0.35
alpha_3 = 0.20
alpha_4 = 0.20

For beta values, considering the metrics' nature:
- For **normalized_length**, a higher value is better, so beta_1 could be around 0.8 or higher to favor larger values.
- For **opportunity**, higher is better, so beta_2 could be around 0.8 or higher.
- For **distance_next**, a lower value is generally more favorable as it indicates closer subsequent occurrences, so beta_3 could be around 0.2 or lower.
- For **local_density**, while a higher value might be somewhat favorable, its importance is relatively lower, so beta_4 could be moderate, around 0.5.

Let's assign:
beta_1 = 0.8
beta_2 = 0.8
beta_3 = 0.2
beta_4 = 0.5

Thus, the output should be:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.20
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
