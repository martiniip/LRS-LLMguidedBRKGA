To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are generally more desirable as they contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1 + gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence if the current run is included.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric gives an idea of how common the character is.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The influence of a node (N) is calculated using a sigmoid function that combines the four metrics with their respective alpha and beta values. The sigmoid function maps the input to a probability between 0 and 1.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha Values**: These represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial because they directly relate to the length and potential of the subsequence. Thus, they might have higher alpha values. **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that could be important but might be secondary.
   - **Beta Values**: These indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should reflect this. For **distance_next**, a lower value is generally more desirable as it indicates the next occurrence of the symbol is soon. For **local_density**, the desirability might depend on the context, but generally, a moderate value could be desirable.

Given the problem's nature and without specific details on how to weigh these metrics beyond their descriptions, a reasonable initial guess might prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, followed by **distance_next** and then **local_density**. 

Let's assign:
- alpha_1 = 0.25 (normalized_length)
- alpha_2 = 0.35 (opportunity)
- alpha_3 = 0.20 (distance_next)
- alpha_4 = 0.20 (local_density)

And for beta values, considering the desirable outcomes:
- beta_1 = 0.8 (preferring longer runs)
- beta_2 = 0.7 (high opportunity is desirable)
- beta_3 = 0.2 (lower distance to next occurrence is desirable)
- beta_4 = 0.5 (moderate local density could be a balance)

Thus, the output in the required format is:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.20
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
