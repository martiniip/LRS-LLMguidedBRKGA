To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that each symbol appears in at most one run, and the total length of the selected runs is maximized.

The provided metrics are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of a run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by \(1/(1 + gap)\), where `gap` likely refers to the distance or gap between consecutive occurrences of the same symbol or run.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The task requires us to infer the importance of each metric in determining the influence of a node (representing a run) on the LRS.

## Step 1: Understand the Metrics
- `normalized_length` is crucial because longer runs contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
- `opportunity` is important as it estimates the potential contribution of a run.
- `distance_next` indicates how soon the same symbol appears again, which is relevant for deciding whether including a run would prevent a longer run of the same symbol later on.
- `local_density` gives an idea of how frequent a character is, which can influence the decision if a character appears frequently, its runs might be more valuable.

## Step 2: Analyze the Importance of Metrics
For the LRS problem, `normalized_length` and `opportunity` seem directly relevant as they relate to the length and potential contribution of runs. `distance_next` is also relevant because it affects whether choosing a run now might preclude a longer run later. `local_density` provides context on character frequency.

## Step 3: Assigning Alpha Values
Given the direct relevance of `normalized_length` and `opportunity` to the LRS problem, they should have higher alpha values. `distance_next` is also important for strategic selection. `local_density`, while informative, might be less directly influential on a per-run basis.

## Step 4: Assigning Beta Values
Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, higher values are generally more desirable, suggesting beta values close to 1 (since values closer to 1 are considered favorable). For `distance_next`, a lower value is desirable (indicating the next occurrence is soon), so its beta value should reflect a preference for lower values, potentially around 0.

## Step 5: Specific Values
Let's consider assigning:
- Alpha values: `alpha_1 = 0.3` for `normalized_length`, `alpha_2 = 0.3` for `opportunity`, `alpha_3 = 0.2` for `distance_next`, and `alpha_4 = 0.2` for `local_density`, reflecting their relative importance.
- Beta values: `beta_1 = 0.8`, `beta_2 = 0.8`, `beta_3 = 0.2`, and `beta_4 = 0.8`, indicating a preference for higher `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, and lower `distance_next`.

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.8
