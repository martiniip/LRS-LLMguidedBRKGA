To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand the influence of each metric on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) from a given string such that the total length of the selected runs is maximized, and each symbol appears in at most one run.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by \(1/(1 + gap)\), where `gap` likely refers to the distance or gap between consecutive occurrences of the same symbol.
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The task requires us to infer the importance of each metric in determining the influence of a node (run) on the LRS.

## Step 1: Understanding the Metrics
- `normalized_length` is crucial because longer runs contribute more to the total length of the LRS.
- `opportunity` is important as it estimates the potential contribution of a run to the LRS, considering the gap between occurrences.
- `distance_next` indicates how soon the same symbol appears again, which is relevant for deciding whether to include a run.
- `local_density` gives an idea of how frequent a character is, which might influence the decision to include a run.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Influence Equation
The influence of a node \(N\) is given by \(\text{Influence(N)} = \text{sigmoid}(\alpha_1 \cdot (1 - (\beta_1 - normalized-length)) + \alpha_2 \cdot (1 - (\beta_2 - opportunity)) + \alpha_3 \cdot (1 - (\beta_3 - distance-next)) + \alpha_4 \cdot (1 - (\beta_4 - local_density)))\). The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of selecting a node.

## Step 3: Determining Alpha and Beta Values
To maximize the LRS, we want to prioritize runs that are long (`normalized_length` is high), have a high `opportunity`, are followed by a reasonable `distance_next` (not too close or too far), and occur in a context where the character is not too frequent or too rare (`local_density`).

## Step 4: Assigning Values
Given the importance of all metrics, we might assign relatively equal or weighted importance to the alpha values based on the problem's requirements. For beta values, we need to consider what values are desirable for each metric.

For `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, higher values are generally more desirable, suggesting beta values around 1. For `distance_next`, a moderate value might be desirable as very close or very far next occurrences might not be ideal.

## Step 5: Finalizing Alpha and Beta
Let's consider assigning alpha values such that they sum to 1 and reflect the relative importance of each metric. Assuming all metrics are somewhat important but `opportunity` and `normalized_length` are crucial, we might assign higher alpha values to these.

Let's directly infer the values based on a balanced approach:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=1
beta_2=1
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.5

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=1
beta_2=1
beta_3=0.5
beta_4=0.5
