To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). A higher opportunity value indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be more desirable as it indicates a potential for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric might influence the selection based on the character's overall presence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability or influence of the node.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) values** represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must be 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) values** are the thresholds or reference points for each metric, indicating where the favorable values lie.

Given the LRS problem's nature, a run with a higher **normalized_length** and **opportunity** is generally more desirable. A smaller **distance_next** could be favorable as it suggests a closer next occurrence, potentially increasing the subsequence length. **local_density** might be less directly influential but still relevant.

Without loss of generality and based on the problem's description, we can infer that:
- **normalized_length** and **opportunity** are crucial, so they should have higher \(\alpha\) values.
- **distance_next** is also important as it affects the potential for a longer subsequence.
- **local_density** is relatively less important compared to the others but still has some influence.

Let's assign:
- Higher \(\alpha\) values to **normalized_length** and **opportunity**.
- Moderate \(\alpha\) value to **distance_next**.
- Lower \(\alpha\) value to **local_density**.

For \(\beta\) values, they should reflect the desirable range for each metric. For instance, a higher **normalized_length** and **opportunity** are desirable, so their \(\beta\) values should be high (close to 1). A lower **distance_next** is desirable, so its \(\beta\) should be low (close to 0). For **local_density**, a moderate \(\beta\) might be reasonable.

Let's consider a possible distribution:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
