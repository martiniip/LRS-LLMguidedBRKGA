To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, given by \(1/(1 + gap)\). A higher opportunity value is desirable as it indicates a potentially larger contribution to the LRS.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance might be desirable as it indicates the symbol appears frequently, potentially allowing for a longer subsequence.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the string. A higher local density might be desirable as it suggests the character is common and could contribute to a longer subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a weighted sum of its metrics. The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for representing a probability or influence.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For the LRS problem, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial because they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run to the LRS.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context about the distribution and frequency of characters, which can indirectly influence the LRS by affecting the selection of non-overlapping runs.

4. **Determining Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should be close to 1.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is desirable, suggesting a beta value close to 0.
   - For **local_density**, a higher value is generally more desirable, suggesting a beta value close to 1.

Given these considerations, a reasonable distribution could prioritize **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, followed by **local_density**, and then **distance_next**. Thus, a possible assignment could be:
alpha_1=0.25
alpha_2=0.35
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.25
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.7
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.8
