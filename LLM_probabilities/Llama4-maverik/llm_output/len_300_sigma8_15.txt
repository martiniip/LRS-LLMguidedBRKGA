To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given data and understand how each metric influences the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are more significant for LRS.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap). Higher opportunity values indicate a higher potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates that the symbol appears again soon, potentially affecting the selection due to non-overlap constraints.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the string. Characters with higher local density might be more or less favorable depending on the context.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node (run) based on its characteristics. The sigmoid function ensures the output is between 0 and 1, representing the probability or influence of selecting a run.

3. **Determining Alpha Values**:
   - Alpha values represent the relative importance of each metric. For LRS, **normalized_length** and **opportunity** seem crucial as they directly relate to the length and potential contribution of a run.
   - **distance_next** and **local_density** provide additional context that could influence the selection, especially in terms of avoiding overlaps and understanding character distribution.

4. **Assigning Alpha Values**:
   Given the importance of **normalized_length** and **opportunity** for directly contributing to the LRS, let's assign them higher values. Assuming **normalized_length** and **opportunity** are equally important, and **distance_next** and **local_density** are less but equally important, we could distribute the alpha values as follows: 
   - alpha_1 = 0.3 for **normalized_length**
   - alpha_2 = 0.3 for **opportunity**
   - alpha_3 = 0.2 for **distance_next**
   - alpha_4 = 0.2 for **local_density**

5. **Determining Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta values should be high (close to 1).
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is desirable to minimize gaps, so a low beta value is appropriate.
   - For **local_density**, the desirability might depend on the context, but generally, a moderate to high value could be seen as favorable for indicating common characters.

6. **Assigning Beta Values**:
   - beta_1 = 0.8 for **normalized_length**, indicating a preference for longer runs.
   - beta_2 = 0.8 for **opportunity**, favoring runs with higher potential contribution.
   - beta_3 = 0.2 for **distance_next**, suggesting a preference for runs with the next occurrence of the same symbol not too far away, but not too close either, to avoid overlap.
   - beta_4 = 0.5 for **local_density**, indicating a moderate preference for characters with average to higher frequency.

Thus, based on the above analysis:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.2
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
