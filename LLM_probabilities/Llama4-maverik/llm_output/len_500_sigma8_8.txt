To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their implications on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - **normalized_length**: The length of a run divided by the total string length. A higher value indicates a longer run.
   - **opportunity**: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, considering the gap between consecutive identical characters. A higher value suggests a greater potential contribution.
   - **distance_next**: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A lower value indicates that the next occurrence is closer.
   - **local_density**: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. A higher value suggests that the character is more frequent.

2. **Analyzing the Importance of Metrics**:
   - For LRS, a longer run (**normalized_length**) is generally more desirable as it contributes more to the total length of the subsequence.
   - **Opportunity** is crucial because it estimates the potential of a run to be included in the LRS, taking into account the gap between occurrences.
   - **distance_next** is important because a smaller distance to the next occurrence might indicate a higher chance of including the next run in the LRS if it's not overlapping.
   - **local_density** gives an idea of how common a character is. A higher local density might suggest that a character has a higher potential to be part of a longer subsequence.

3. **Assigning Alpha Values**:
   - Given the definitions, **opportunity** and **normalized_length** seem to be directly relevant to the LRS problem, suggesting that their alpha values should be higher.
   - Let's assign higher alpha values to **opportunity** and **normalized_length**, and distribute the remaining weight among **distance_next** and **local_density**.

4. **Assigning Beta Values**:
   - Beta values indicate the desirable range for each metric. For **normalized_length** and **opportunity**, higher values are desirable, so beta should be close to 1.
   - For **distance_next**, a lower value is preferable, so beta should be close to 0.
   - For **local_density**, a moderate to higher value might be desirable, but since it's a frequency measure, a beta around 0.5 or slightly higher could be reasonable.

Based on the above analysis, a possible distribution could be:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.15
alpha_4=0.15
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.8
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.6
