To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand their impact on the Longest Run Subsequence (LRS) problem. The LRS problem involves selecting runs (maximal sequences of consecutive identical characters) such that each symbol appears in at most one run, and the total length of the selected runs is maximized.

The metrics provided are:
1. `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length.
2. `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as 1/(1+gap).
3. `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol.
4. `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length.

The influence of a node (run) is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Influence(N)} = \text{sigmoid}\left(\alpha_1 \cdot (1 - (\beta_1 - normalized-length)) + \alpha_2 \cdot (1 - (\beta_2 - opportunity)) + \alpha_3 \cdot (1 - (\beta_3 - distance-next)) + \alpha_4 \cdot (1 - (\beta_4 - local_density))\right) \]

Given the constraints that \(\sum_{i=1}^{4} \alpha_i = 1\) and \(0 < \alpha_i < 1\), and \(0 < \beta_i < 1\), we need to infer the values of \(\alpha_i\) and \(\beta_i\).

For the LRS problem, a run is more likely to be selected if it has a larger `normalized_length`, higher `opportunity`, smaller `distance_next` (indicating closer next occurrence), and potentially higher `local_density` (though this might be less directly influential).

Let's assign values based on the relative importance of these metrics for the LRS problem:
- `normalized_length` and `opportunity` are directly related to the length and potential contribution of a run, making them crucial.
- `distance_next` is important as it affects the possibility of selecting subsequent runs without violating the constraint of not having overlapping runs of the same symbol.
- `local_density` provides context about the character's frequency but is less directly related to the selection criterion.

Thus, we might prioritize `opportunity` and `normalized_length` over `distance_next` and `local_density`. However, without specific weights or further analysis, a straightforward distribution could be assigning higher values to `alpha_1` and `alpha_2`, and relatively lower but still significant values to `alpha_3` and `alpha_4`.

For beta values, they should reflect the desirable outcomes:
- For `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `local_density`, higher values are desirable, so \(\beta_i\) should be close to 1.
- For `distance_next`, a lower value is desirable, so \(\beta_3\) should be close to 0.

Let's consider a simple distribution for alpha that prioritizes `opportunity` and `normalized_length`, and for beta that reflects desirable outcomes.

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.4
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.8
beta_2=0.9
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.8
