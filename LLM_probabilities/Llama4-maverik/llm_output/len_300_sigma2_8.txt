To determine the appropriate values for the alpha and beta parameters, we need to analyze the given Evaluation Graph metrics and understand how they influence the selection process for the Longest Run Subsequence problem.

1. **Understanding the Metrics**:
   - `normalized_length`: The length of the run divided by the total string length. Longer runs are more significant.
   - `opportunity`: Estimated potential contribution of the run to the total LRS, calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 + \text{gap}} \). Higher opportunity values indicate a greater potential contribution.
   - `distance_next`: Normalized distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol. A smaller distance indicates a closer next occurrence, potentially increasing the likelihood of selecting the current run.
   - `local_density`: Frequency of the character in the entire string divided by its total length. This metric provides insight into the character's overall presence.

2. **Analyzing the Influence Equation**:
   The given equation calculates the influence of a node based on the sigmoid function of a weighted sum of the metrics. The weights (\(\alpha\)) and the desirable results (\(\beta\)) for each metric are crucial.

3. **Determining Alpha and Beta Values**:
   - **Alpha (\(\alpha\)) Values**: Represent the relative importance of each metric. The sum of all \(\alpha\) values must equal 1.
   - **Beta (\(\beta\)) Values**: Indicate the desirable level for each metric, serving as a kind of threshold or reference point.

Given the task's constraints and the need to maximize the length of the Longest Run Subsequence, we prioritize metrics that directly contribute to this goal.

- `normalized_length` and `opportunity` are directly related to the length and potential contribution of runs, making them crucial.
- `distance_next` is important because a smaller distance to the next occurrence of the same symbol can indicate a higher chance of having longer subsequences.
- `local_density` provides context but is less directly related to the immediate decision of selecting a run.

Thus, we might prioritize `normalized_length`, `opportunity`, and `distance_next` over `local_density` because they are more directly related to the selection and length of runs.

Let's assign:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.3
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.5
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5

The final answer is:
alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.3
alpha_3=0.3
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.5
beta_3=0.2
beta_4=0.5
